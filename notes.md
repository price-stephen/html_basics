Introduction to HTML

    What is it?
        -No matter what browser you use - they all have a single purpose. That is to interpret your HTML, CSS and Javascript files into a displayable website.

        -HTML is the foundation of websites. You can create website with only HTML. HTML allows you to display a website with the bare bones structure. 

        -HyperText Markup Language. 
            XML = Extensible Markup Language
            GML = Generalized Markup Language   

        -History
            They all share a history - editorial markups of manuscripts.
            HTML works the same way. You can specify the layout and structure of your website - using HTML tags <>.
