Introduction to HTML

    What is it?
        -No matter what browser you use - they all have a single purpose. That is to interpret your HTML, CSS and Javascript files into a displayable website.

        -HTML is the foundation of websites. You can create website with only HTML. HTML allows you to display a website with the bare bones structure. 

        -HyperText Markup Language. 
            XML = Extensible Markup Language
            GML = Generalized Markup Language   

        -History
            They all share a history - editorial markups of manuscripts.
            HTML works the same way. You can specify the layout and structure of your website - using HTML tags <>. 
        
The Anatomy of an HTML Tag   
    
    <h1>Hello World</h1>

        -Start tag -> <h1>
        -Content -> Hello World 
        -End tag -> </h1>

    <br>

        -This is an example of a self-closing tag (<hr> is another example of a self-closing tag).
    
    <hr size="3">

        -size="3" is the HTML attribute; it comes after the element and it is seperated by a space.
